Lists are fundamental data structures in computer science, and they
play a crucial role in organizing and manipulating data efficiently. 

In Go, we can implement various types of lists, including linked lists
and doubly linked lists. These structures offer unique advantages
and are suitable for different scenarios depending on the
requirements of the application.

Letâ€™s start by examining linked lists. A linked list is a linear data
structure where elements are stored in nodes. 

Each node contains the data and a reference (or link) to the next node in the sequence.
The last node typically points to nil, indicating the end of the list.
Linked lists are dynamic, allowing for efficient insertion and deletion
operations, especially when dealing with large datasets.
