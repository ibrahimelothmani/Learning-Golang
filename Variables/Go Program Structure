Go Program Structure

1.  main lets the Go compiler know that we want this code to compile and run as a standalone program,
as opposed to being a library that's imported by other programs.

2. import "fmt" imports the fmt (formatting) package from the standard library.
It allows us to use fmt.Println to print to the console.

3. func main() defines the main function, the entry point for a Go program.

Two Kinds of Bugs
Generally speaking, there are two kinds of errors in programming:

1. Compilation errors. Occur when code is compiled.
It's generally better to have compilation errors because they'll never accidentally make it into production.
You can't ship a program with a compiler error because the resulting executable won't even be created.

2. Runtime errors. Occur when a program is running.
These are generally worse because they can cause your program to crash or behave unexpectedly.

While we're in the browser it can be a bit hard to tell the difference because we run and compile the code in the same step.
