Generally speaking, languages that compile directly to machine code produce programs that are faster than interpreted programs.

Go is one of the fastest programming languages, beating JavaScript, Python, and Ruby handily in most benchmarks.

However, Go programs don't run quite as fast as its compiled Rust, Zig, and C counterparts.
That said, it compiles much faster than they do, which makes the developer experience super productive.
Unfortunately, there are no swordfights on Go teams...
